### GitHub Problem Description ###
Bug with milli prefix
What happened:
```
In [1]: from sympy.physics.units import milli, W
In [2]: milli*W == 1
Out[2]: True
In [3]: W*milli
Out[3]: watt*Prefix(milli, m, -3, 10)
```
What I expected to happen: milli*W should evaluate to milli watts / mW

`milli*W` or more generally `milli` times some unit evaluates to the number 1. I have tried this with Watts and Volts, I'm not sure what other cases this happens. I'm using sympy version 1.11.1-1 on Arch Linux with Python 3.10.9. If you cannot reproduce I would be happy to be of any assitance.

Please provide the class name, function or method name, or the exact line numbers that need to be edited.
### Examples:
```
full_path1/file1.py
line: 10
class: MyClass1
line: 51

full_path2/file2.py
function: MyClass2.my_method
line: 12

full_path3/file3.py
function: my_function
line: 24
line: 156
```

Return just the location(s)

2024-08-22 06:47:09,851 - INFO - Based on the problem description, it appears that the issue lies in how the `milli` prefix is being handled when multiplied with units like `W` (Watt) or `V` (Volt).

To fix this bug, you'll likely need to modify the following locations in the SymPy library:

```
sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py
class: Prefix
line: 27

sympy/physics/units/quantities.py
function: Quantity.__mul__
line: 274
```

In the `Prefix` class, you may need to adjust how the prefix is applied to the unit during multiplication.

In the `Quantity.__mul__` method, you'll want to ensure that when a prefix is multiplied with a unit, it correctly scales the unit rather than evaluating to 1.

Please note that these line numbers are approximate and based on the latest version of SymPy available at the time of this response. You may need to adjust them depending on the specific version you are working with.
