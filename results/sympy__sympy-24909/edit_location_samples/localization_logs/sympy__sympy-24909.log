### GitHub Problem Description ###
Bug with milli prefix
What happened:
```
In [1]: from sympy.physics.units import milli, W
In [2]: milli*W == 1
Out[2]: True
In [3]: W*milli
Out[3]: watt*Prefix(milli, m, -3, 10)
```
What I expected to happen: milli*W should evaluate to milli watts / mW

`milli*W` or more generally `milli` times some unit evaluates to the number 1. I have tried this with Watts and Volts, I'm not sure what other cases this happens. I'm using sympy version 1.11.1-1 on Arch Linux with Python 3.10.9. If you cannot reproduce I would be happy to be of any assitance.

Please provide the class name, function or method name, or the exact line numbers that need to be edited.
### Examples:
```
full_path1/file1.py
line: 10
class: MyClass1
line: 51

full_path2/file2.py
function: MyClass2.my_method
line: 12

full_path3/file3.py
function: my_function
line: 24
line: 156
```

Return just the location(s)

2024-08-22 06:48:17,980 - INFO - Here are the locations that likely need to be edited to fix the issue with the milli prefix:

sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py
class: Prefix
line: 49

sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py
function: UnitSystem._eval_mul
line: 623

sympy/physics/units/quantities.py
function: Quantity._eval_mul
line: 277

The key areas to investigate are:
1) The Prefix class, specifically how it handles multiplication 
2) The _eval_mul method in UnitSystem which determines how units are multiplied
3) The _eval_mul method in Quantity, to check if there is special handling needed when a Quantity is multiplied by a Prefix

Examining and likely modifying the code in those locations should allow fixing the bug where milli*W evaluates to 1 instead of milli watts. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
